# NavExa

### AI-Powered Seamless Navigation

## About the Project

NavExa is an AI-based navigation prototype designed to provide
seamless vehicle navigation when GPS/NavIC signals become unavailable.

The system demonstrates the use of Dead Reckoning to continue
navigation during GPS-denied situations such as tunnels.

## Problem

GPS/NavIC signals may become unavailable in tunnels and other
GPS-denied environments, causing interruptions in navigation.

## Proposed Solution

NavExa combines satellite-based navigation with AI-assisted
Dead Reckoning to maintain continuous navigation during temporary
signal loss.

## Main Features

* GPS/NavIC-based navigation
* Vehicle movement on map
* GPS-denied tunnel simulation
* AI Dead Reckoning mode
* Automatic navigation-status changes
* Navigation analytics

## Technology Used

* Flutter
* Dart
* Python
* AI/ML
* GPS/NavIC
* IMU/Sensor data
* Map technology
